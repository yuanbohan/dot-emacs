;; On OS X, an Emacs instance started from the graphical user
;; interface will have a different environment than a shell in a
;; terminal window, because OS X does not run a shell during the
;; login. Obviously this will lead to unexpected results when
;; calling external utilities like make from Emacs.
;; This library works around this problem by copying important
;; environment variables from the user's shell.
