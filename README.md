# Personal Emacs configuration

move `init.el` to `~/.emacs/init.el` and `conf/conf.el` to `~/.emacs/conf/conf.el`, start Emacs and all the packages will be downloaded

- I use GNU Emacs
- make sure you can connect to the melpa
- you need to install related packages on your system if you are using one programming language before you can use some package in Emacs

## major prod mode

- [x] Rust
- [x] Clojure
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Erlang
- [ ] Golang
- [ ] R (ESS)

## useful packages

 - use package
 - cider (compile, ut, debug)
 - magit (git)
 - smartparens (strengthen the paredit mode)
 - projectile
 - helm (file, buffer quick switch)
 - helm swoop
 - company
 - rainbow-delimiters
 - which key
 - avy
 - ace window
 - multiple cursor
 - expand region
 - neotree
 - dracula theme
 - yasnippet
